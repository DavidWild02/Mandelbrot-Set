An Application to visualize the famous Mandelbrot-Set. <br/>

This is how the application looks like. <br/>
On the left side you have the Mandelbrot-set and on the right side the julia-set. <br/> 
You can choose a point from the Mandelbrot-set and let it create the appropiate julia-set.

you can zoom into and scroll around the mandelbrot set. For that you can use the mouse or the Textfield.

If you click choose formula you can display the mandelbrot set with k = 3. <br/>
So you plot z = z^3 + c instead of z = z^2 + c

I hope you enjoy the app, like I did.
